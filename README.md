At first I created a Google Cloud project on the project selector page and filled in the necessary information. 
After creating the project, I enabled the Google Kubernetes Engine API. 
Then I went to the console and activated the Cloud Shell Button and set up my project as default and authorized the cloud shell. 
I went to the Kubernetes engine and then cluster and after that I created the cluster and configured the cluster settings such as the ID, zone and node.
After configuring the cluster settings, I went to the cluster section and connected the cluster to kubectl. 
In the Github account, I created a new repository following the name and also included the README file and made it public.
